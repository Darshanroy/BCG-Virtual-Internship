    "\n",
    "1. Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.\n",
    "2. The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.\n",
    "3. PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to 4. use another service provider, this is called churn.\n",
    "5. This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the meeting your AD discussed some potential reasons for this churn, one being how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?\n",

    "\n",
    "Dear [Associate Director's Name],\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this email finds you well. Estelle and I have thoroughly reviewed PowerCo's churn issue and outlined a plan to investigate it using the 5-step data science methodology. Here are the major steps we propose:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation:\n",
    "**Business Understanding & Problem Framing**\n",
    "\n",
    "PowerCo is facing a significant challenge with customer churn, and our goal is to understand the key reasons behind customers deciding to stay or switch energy providers. We will approach this using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Reasons for Customer Decision:**\n",
    "    - Price Sensitivity\n",
    "    - Energy Quality (Clean Energy)\n",
    "    - Customer Service\n",
    "    - Location Accessibility\n",
    "    - Reward Programs and Discounts\n",
    "    - Service Offerings and Contract Terms\n",
    "    - Maintenance Quality\n",
    "    - Smart Technology Integration\n",
    "    - Community Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Needed:**\n",
    "    - Customer purchasing trends over the past 5 years\n",
    "    - Geographic location of businesses\n",
    "    - Customer service logs and feedback\n",
    "    - Energy usage patterns and preferences\n",
    "    - Contract terms and flexibility data\n",
    "    - Smart technology adoption data\n",
    "    - Community engagement records\n",
    "    - Competitor data for benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis and Visualization Techniques:**\n",
    "    - **Statistical Analysis:**\n",
    "        - Mean, Median, Standard Deviation to understand central tendencies.\n",
    "        - Univariate and Multivariate Analysis to explore distributions and relationships.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "        - Create new features to capture additional insights from the existing data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "        - Test hypotheses related to the impact of various factors on churn.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Model Building:**\n",
    "        - Utilize cluster analysis to identify customer segments with distinct behaviors.\n",
    "        - Evaluate the model using training and testing datasets.\n",
    "        - Leverage SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Visualization:**\n",
    "        - Visualize trends and patterns using line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps.\n",
    "        - Present geographical insights using maps.\n",
    "        - Use cluster visualizations to showcase distinct customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "We plan to start by acquiring the necessary data from PowerCo, conduct exploratory data analysis, and proceed with in-depth analyses using the outlined techniques. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can help PowerCo address the issue of customer churn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to provide any additional guidance or specific preferences you may have for this analysis. We are committed to delivering valuable insights that align with BCG GAMMA's standards.\n",

    "\n",

    "# Here is some context around the additional features that have been engineered in the notebook, to help you in the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we have the average price changes across periods. This is a measure of the average price change by company between peak, mid-peak and off peak periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then take this idea one step further by creating another similar feature but instead of looking at the average price difference, we look at the maximum price difference across periods and months. This gives another way to look at the price changes across months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why these 2 features could be useful is because they are another way of representing the variance of prices throughout the year. Imagine, if your utilities bill massively increased over winter, as a consumer you’d be annoyed and want to find a better deal!\n",
    "\n",
    "After this we continue feature engineering with some more concepts, including transformation of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions with a statistical or machine learning algorithm, all of the data must be converted to numeric data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we convert date into months and remove the raw date column, as we cannot use it in its original form.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also convert boolean columns into binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we convert categorical columns into dummy variables. A dummy variable is a binary flag that indicates when a row matches the value from the categorical column that it was created from.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw during exploratory data analysis, the distribution of some columns was skewed. This is important to identify because when modeling data for prediction, based on the technique or algorithm that we use, there are sometimes assumptions within the data that we should follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common assumption is that the columns within the data are normally distributed. Hence, if we find that columns are not normally distributed, we should treat these columns to try and transform them into a distribution that is more normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the next thing we do is transform some columns to have a closer to normal distribution. We do this using the logarithm function. As you can see from the visualisations, the newly transformed columns are much closer to a normal distribution than what they were earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we plot correlations of all the columns to see if we can identify any columns to remove. Columns that have very high correlations indicate an area to look out for. In this case, you may want to remove one of the columns, since they are likely both holding very similar information."
