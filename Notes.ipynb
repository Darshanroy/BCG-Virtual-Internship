    "\n",
    "1. Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.\n",
    "2. The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.\n",
    "3. PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to 4. use another service provider, this is called churn.\n",
    "5. This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the meeting your AD discussed some potential reasons for this churn, one being how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Dear [Associate Director's Name],\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this email finds you well. Estelle and I have thoroughly reviewed PowerCo's churn issue and outlined a plan to investigate it using the 5-step data science methodology. Here are the major steps we propose:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation:\n",
    "**Business Understanding & Problem Framing**\n",
    "\n",
    "PowerCo is facing a significant challenge with customer churn, and our goal is to understand the key reasons behind customers deciding to stay or switch energy providers. We will approach this using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Reasons for Customer Decision:**\n",
    "    - Price Sensitivity\n",
    "    - Energy Quality (Clean Energy)\n",
    "    - Customer Service\n",
    "    - Location Accessibility\n",
    "    - Reward Programs and Discounts\n",
    "    - Service Offerings and Contract Terms\n",
    "    - Maintenance Quality\n",
    "    - Smart Technology Integration\n",
    "    - Community Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Needed:**\n",
    "    - Customer purchasing trends over the past 5 years\n",
    "    - Geographic location of businesses\n",
    "    - Customer service logs and feedback\n",
    "    - Energy usage patterns and preferences\n",
    "    - Contract terms and flexibility data\n",
    "    - Smart technology adoption data\n",
    "    - Community engagement records\n",
    "    - Competitor data for benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis and Visualization Techniques:**\n",
    "    - **Statistical Analysis:**\n",
    "        - Mean, Median, Standard Deviation to understand central tendencies.\n",
    "        - Univariate and Multivariate Analysis to explore distributions and relationships.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "        - Create new features to capture additional insights from the existing data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "        - Test hypotheses related to the impact of various factors on churn.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Model Building:**\n",
    "        - Utilize cluster analysis to identify customer segments with distinct behaviors.\n",
    "        - Evaluate the model using training and testing datasets.\n",
    "        - Leverage SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Visualization:**\n",
    "        - Visualize trends and patterns using line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps.\n",
    "        - Present geographical insights using maps.\n",
    "        - Use cluster visualizations to showcase distinct customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "We plan to start by acquiring the necessary data from PowerCo, conduct exploratory data analysis, and proceed with in-depth analyses using the outlined techniques. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can help PowerCo address the issue of customer churn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to provide any additional guidance or specific preferences you may have for this analysis. We are committed to delivering valuable insights that align with BCG GAMMA's standards.\n",
